            <h2>My Portfolio!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My journey into the world of design has been nothing short of eclectic, shaped by diverse experiences and a relentless passion for creativity. Let me take you through my path:</p>
            <p>After graduating high school in 2016, I pursued my interest in beauty and aesthetics by attending a technical school to obtain my Esthetician's license. While delving into the world of skincare and beauty, I discovered my fascination with the intricate world of digital technology and cybersecurity. This curiosity led me to embark on a course in Cybersecurity, where I honed my skills in data protection and network security.</p>  
            <p>However, my heart was ultimately drawn to the dynamic realm of graphic and interactive design. Currently, I am pursuing an Associate's degree in Science, specializing in Graphic/Interactive Design. Throughout my academic journey, I have immersed myself in a multitude of design tools and software. In high school, I obtained certifications in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premier Pro, laying the foundation for my proficiency in these essential design platforms. In my current classes, I continue to expand my skills in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, pushing the boundaries of creativity with each project. I have also begun exploring HTML coding with VS Code.</p>
            <p>In addition to these industry-standard tools, I am also well-versed in Canva, leveraging its user-friendly interface to create compelling marketing materials such as brochures, business cards, and flyers. My experience extends beyond the classroom; I have had the privilege of managing social media accounts and crafting marketing collateral for various employers. This hands-on experience has equipped me with the ability to communicate effectively with clients and tailor my designs to meet their unique needs and preferences.</p>
            <p>As a designer, I pride myself on staying ahead of the curve, constantly seeking inspiration from emerging trends while infusing my work with a style that is uniquely mine. My portfolio is a testament to my dedication to pushing the boundaries of design, creating visually stunning experiences that captivate and engage audiences. Thank you for taking the time to explore my workâ€”I look forward to connecting with you and bringing your vision to life!</p>
